This subreddit is great for testing purposes. Cant test sticky comment as need moderator access.


# TO DO

Add a script that checks the nhl_api schedule for a game today. If there is a game, make a comment on the HockeyMod game thread post 5 hours before game time (IDK when hockeymod posts the thread). 

Add in intro code comment to each function explaining functionality.

Could make the entire script run without data storage, depends on where the bot is hosted.
